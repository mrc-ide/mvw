## Session aims:

-   A whistle-stop tour of some other malariaverse packages
-   umbrella: for fitting seasonal profiles
-   treasure: unit costing
-   om: for (budget-constrained) stratification optimisation

## Umbrella

-   :package: \[malariasimulation\] captures the seasonality in transmission using fourier series parameters fitted to rainfall data.
-   :package: \[umbrella\] includes some simple functionality to fit these parameters.
-   :package: \[umbrella\] also has some helper functions to download CHIRPS rainfall "data".
-   `site_file$seasonality` has fitted seasonal parameters for the default sites.

## Umbrella workflow

1.  Define your spatial data. This will be spatial polygon(s). I like to use the :package: \[sf\] for spatial data. (I have downloaded and processed `sf` files associated with all sites.)
2.  Access satellite rainfall "data" rasters for the region/period/resolution you require
3.  Extract rainfall data associated with your spatial units
4.  Use `umbrella::fit_fourier()` to fit parameters that can be used in a site file, or directly in :package: \[malariasimulation\].

## Umbrella caveats

1.  Usually use a single, representative seasonal profile for sites.

-   Needed for forwards projections
-   May miss inter- and intra-annual variation of interest

2.  The assumption that :arrow_up: rain = :arrow_up: mosquitoes = :arrow_up: malaria does not always hold!

## Umbrella info

-   Check out the (umbrella website)\[https://mrc-ide.github.io/umbrella/\] for more information and a simple introduction vignette.

## treasure

-   :package: [treasure], is a simple repository for unit costing information that has been used to cost out large global/country scenarios
-   Mostly serves as a single, version controlled reference for unit costs collected from the literature, WHO and Global Fund.
-   No time- or country-specific costing information. 
-   If anyone is interested in improving the database, please let me know!

## om

-   A common challenge is finding the optimum package of interventions across a country, where interventions can be targeted sub-nationally.
-   Often this question is asked with the additional constraint of a finite budget.
-   :package: [om] is here to help!

## om inputs

-   :package: [om] requires specific inputs to work:
-   An impact matrix giving details of the outcome measure we are optimising, for example cases averted. Each row of the matrix is a sub-unit (e.g. district) and each column a unique intervention package.
-   A cost matrix giving details of the associated cost of each option in the impact matrix
-   A budget

## om and complex budgets

-   The budget specification in :package: [om] can be simple: e.g. \$100
-   It can also be more complex. For example we might want to optimise the intervention packages across 5 countries, where each country has a domestic budget (to be spent internally) as well as a shared regional budget.

## om info

-   Check out the (om website)\[https://mrc-ide.github.io/om/index.html\] for more information, a simple introduction vignette and a guide for implementing complex budgets.
