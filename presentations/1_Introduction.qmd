## Welcome all!

Today's aims:

-   Provide a broad overview of context-specific modelling
-   Site files: how to characterise a setting
-   Introduce the malariaverse packages to support :package:\[malariasimulation\] modelling
-   Exercises:
    -   Running a site
    -   Calibrating a site
    -   Dealing with bed nets

## Modelling philosophy {.smaller}

One common dichotomisation is between:

1.  Generic modelling
    -   Run the model for generic settings (e.g. Low/Medium/High *Pf*Pr~2-10~)
    -   Allows precise exploration of model behaviour and intervention impact in controlled in silico environment
    -   Can be challenging to translate general results
    -   e.g. Modelling population-level impact to inform target product profiles for childhood malaria vaccines. Hogan *et al* BMC Medicine, 2018.

## Modelling philosophy {.smaller}

One common dichotomisation is between:

2.  Context-specific modelling
    -   Run the model for a specific setting/location
    -   Can be used to inform policy and impact assessment for specific areas
    -   Requires "the context" to be adequately captured
    -   e.g. Estimated impact of RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine allocation strategies in sub-Saharan Africa: A modelling study Hogan *et al* PLoS Medicine, 2020.

How do we characterise a setting?

## Important features {.smaller}

-   Intrinsic transmission potential ("Baseline", "Carrying capacity", "R0")
-   The mosquito vector
    -   species
    -   bionomics (how the :mosquito: relates to its environment) & behaviour
    -   distribution & relative abundance
    -   insecticide resistance
-   Rainfall seasonality
-   Historical interventions
-   Epidemiological data (e.g. *Pf*Pr~2-10~, malaria cases)
-   Human population & demography

## Important features

-   For many of these elements there are data available, for example:
    -   [World Malaria Report](Country%20profiles,%20intervention,%20burden%20and%20economic%20data)
    -   [Malaria Atlas project](https://malariaatlas.org/) (burden and intervention coverage estimates)
    -   [Vector Atlas](http://www.vectoratlas.icipe.org/) (spatial vector data, under development and building on work by Sinka *et al*)

## Site files {.smaller}

-   Historically, the group has collected the required information to characterise a setting into a "Site file".
-   We have tried to formalise this approach in malariaverse
-   The :package:\[foresite\] package contains our first-pass attempt at site-files for all countries
-   They contains estimates for all of the important features needed to characterise a site
-   The [foresite website](https://mrc-ide.github.io/foresite/) contains detailed information about each element of a site file

## Site files

-   Site files in :package:\[foresite\] are defined at the first administrative unit level and further disaggregated between urban and rural populations

## Site files

-   We can view all the sites associated with a country site-file in :package:\[foresite\]

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(foresite)
TGO$sites
```

## Site files

-   We can also start to examine other characteristics for the sites

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(foresite)
# Malaria Atlas Project prevalence estimates
TGO$prevalence
```

## Site files

-   We can also start to examine other characteristics for the sites

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(foresite)
# Historical intervention coverage
TGO$interventions[,c(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9)]
```

## Using site files {.smaller}

-   The site files in :package:\[foresite\] are a general attempt to collate information for all malaria-endemic settings
-   They are, at best, a coarse representation of the true picture
-   Please always consider your use-case carefully, it is likely you may
    -   Have direct or be working with people with direct knowledge of a setting
    -   Have more location specific data
    -   Have more up to date data
    -   Want to model at a different spatial scale
-   The Malariaverse aims to provide you with the tools to be able to make necessary improvements to site files

## Running a site

-   We can use another malariaverse :package:\[site\] to translate the site file information into :package:\[malariasimulation\] parameter input.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Isolate a single site from a country
example_site <- site::single_site(foresite::TGO, 1)
# Create parameter inputs
site_pars <- site::site_parameters(
  interventions = example_site$interventions,
  demography = example_site$demography,
  vectors = example_site$vectors,
  seasonality = example_site$seasonality,
  eir = example_site$eir$eir[1],
  overrides = list(human_population = 10000)
)
# Run!
model_run <- malariasimulation::run_simulation(timesteps = site_pars$timesteps,
                                               parameters = site_pars)
```

## Let's give it a try!

-   :package: \[mvw\] has interactive tutorials. You can run code within the tutorial window (or in R/Rstudio if desired).
-   Run `mvw::run_tutorial("Introduction")`
