# :coffee: Coffee break activity :coffee:

On your table you should find post-it notes, pens and green stickers. During the coffee/lunch breaks and throughout the day please:

1.  On post-it notes, write down ideas for how to improve the malariaverse:

-   New features
-   Additional packages
-   Improvements to current packages
-   Ways to maximise academic impact
-   Ways to maximise access/use

2.  Stick your ideas where you think they lie on the Effort vs Impact plane on the board

3.  Up-vote the ideas of others with a dot sticker

There will be time at the end of the day to review and discuss suggestions
