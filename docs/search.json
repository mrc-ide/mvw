Some outputs are more sensitive than others and exploration of a suitable warmup period to use should be performed prior to calibration.\nSubsequent model runs after calibration should use the same warmup period as the calibration.\n\nData 📑\n\nIt will be your decision on what data (and how much of it) to calibrate to\nIt is important to understand how and when data were collected, for example data collected at peak malaria season may look very different to that collected in the low season."
